# Log-in System
A simple Python function used for creating and storing hashed password with associated usernames.

Aside from the actual functionality - the goal of this project was to make use of new tools such as Bcrypt and become generally more effictive programmer gaining experience with Python, Git, SQL and also develop skills with the SQLite 3 module in python. 

Features
System will ask user to input a username and password. If the system does not recognise the username, then the system will instead ask user to create a new username and password (account). It will then store these details allowing the user to correctly log in next time.
If the user inputs password incorrectly, the system will ask the user to re-try.

If both username and password are entered correctly, then the system will proceed sending a "Success, Welcome 'User'!" message. 


Have made use of both Python and SQL skills (SQLite)
